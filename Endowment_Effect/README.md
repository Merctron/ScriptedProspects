# The Endowment Effect

The Endowment Effect is the tendency of individuals, who are in possession of an item they intend to use, to value their item in excess of what it would be sold for in the market. 

## The Role of Loss Aversion

While a rational actor would only be concerned with the market value of an item, human individuals make decisions based on past history and are prone to loss aversion, i.e, the cost associated with the loss of an item that would have provided utility.

## Adjusted Indifference Maps

Classic economic theory about rational actors is states that there are indifference curves for two items that can be exchanged (for example money and a product) and that the curve is impacted by diminishing returns based on your current state. This fails to take into account the loss aversion experienced by actors in relation to their current reference point.
